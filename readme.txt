Seasonal Content is a flexible Elementor addon that keeps your content fresh and in season — all year round.

== Description ==

**Seasonal Content** is a lightweight and flexible addon for Elementor that allows you to automatically change content based on custom seasonal categories with specific dates.

Whether it's winter sales, summer greetings, or national holidays — this plugin helps you display the right content at the right time.
Ideal for shops, landing pages, and promotional content that changes throughout the year — without needing to manually update your site.

This plugin **repeats the content cycle every year**, so you can "set it and forget it" for recurring events like New Year, Black Friday, Summer Sales, etc.

All content is handled via Elementor interface — no custom post types, no shortcodes, no clutter.

== Features ==

- Custom seasonal categories with start/end dates
- Change content inside Elementor widgets (text, heading, background)
- Automatically switches when date changes
- Seasonal categories repeat every year automatically
- Lightweight and SEO-friendly

== Planned Features ==
- Support for more Elementor widgets.
- Plugin settings: change the cron schedule for date checks and add different content update processes.
- Option to create **non-repeating content cycles** (one-time content for specific dates).
- Export/import seasonal categories.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/seasonal-content/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* screen in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work without Elementor? =  
Currently, only Elementor is supported.

= Is this plugin SEO friendly? =  
Yes! The content switch happens visually and does not rely on database queries or Ajax, so it can be cached.

= Will this slow down my site? =  
Not at all. It uses just two WordPress options and no dynamic logic on the frontend.

= Can I add images for background? =  
Yes, background images of parent sections can be changed based on date.
